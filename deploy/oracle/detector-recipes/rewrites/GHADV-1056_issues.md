# GHADV-1056 — ArcadeDB: Privilege escalation via reader role in /api/v1/command JS scripting language — arbitrary host file read

**Status:** NEEDS-REWRITE

**Detector Type:** OCI_ACTIVITY

**Issues:**
- Query is generic SQL, needs conversion to Cloud Guard detector condition

**Original Query:**
```
SELECT "siem_privilege_escalation_ghadv_1056", "data__json.rEventName" FROM "oci_monitoring_metricexplorer_metrics" WHERE "compartmentId" = '$COMPARTMENT_ID' AND "namespace" = 'AuditEvents' AND "data__json.rEventName" LIKE '%arcadedb%' AND "value" > 0
```

**Recipe file (with rewrite):** /Users/claw/.openclaw/workspace/siem-alert-rules/deploy/oracle/detector-recipes/GHADV-1056_detector_recipe.json
