# GHADV-4204 — Apache Wicket has an Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability

**Status:** NEEDS-REWRITE

**Detector Type:** OCI_ACTIVITY

**Issues:**
- Query is generic SQL, needs conversion to Cloud Guard detector condition

**Original Query:**
```
SELECT "siem_info_disclosure_ghadv_4204", "data__json.rEventName" FROM "oci_monitoring_metricexplorer_metrics" WHERE "compartmentId" = '$COMPARTMENT_ID' AND "namespace" = 'AuditEvents' AND "data__json.rEventName" LIKE '%apache%' AND "value" > 0
```

**Recipe file (with rewrite):** /Users/claw/.openclaw/workspace/siem-alert-rules/deploy/oracle/detector-recipes/GHADV-4204_detector_recipe.json
